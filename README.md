# CTF Challenge: Security Misconfiguration

This repository contains the frontend for a CTF challenge. The goal is to find the exposed API key and use it to access the employee data from the backend.

## The Challenge

A developer has accidentally exposed an API key in the frontend code. Your mission is to find this API key and use it to retrieve the list of employees from the backend server.

### Hints

*   Check all the files in the frontend repository.
*   The API key is used to authenticate with the backend server.
*   The backend server is running at `http://localhost:5000`.
*   The endpoint to get the employee data is `/api/employees`.
*   You will need to use a tool like `curl` or Postman to make a request to the backend with the API key.

## Installation

1.  Make sure you have the backend server running.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in the `public` directory in your web browser.

Happy Hacking!
